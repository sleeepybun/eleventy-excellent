## I believe each of us can change the world.

Everyone can make this world a little better, or a little worse — often without thinking.

I believe in the power of making things that improve the world, bit by bit.

Bit by literal bit, in some cases.

I believe in ethics, in humanity, in inclusivity.

Since design is deliberate and considered, both deliberation and consideration should be part of every design.

Design is political.

I believe in the power of giving a shit, but not so much that it undermines your work. That balance is powerful, but tough to attain.

I believe in the power of small teams. I believe that collaboration produces better work than individuals, even “rock stars.” I believe there’s a peak to this benefit: teams that are too big kill productivity. If you’re spending more time organizing than executing, your team is too large.

That said, design requires variance of inputs and creators. Not only should you seek out the individuals that will use whatever you’re designing, the creating team should include a multiplicity of backgrounds and experiences and, yes, points of view.

I believe that fixing problems begins with recognizing them. Pointing out problems is the first step: respect those that do so rather than greeting them with denial, or worse, indifference. That multiplicity of voices will help you recognize problems, and also solutions, that others might miss — but only if those voices feel they’ll be listened to.

I believe the course of history leans toward progress, but it’s easy to knock us back a few decades. This has rarely been truer than right now.

I believe that the right to express your opinion stops when it threatens anyone’s life, anyone’s right to exist.

I am not a pacifist, but I believe in the power of nonviolent protest.

I believe everyone contains their best self, though only some of us are working on it. I surround myself with people that expect the best of me. I also do my best to expect the best of those around me.

I believe diversity makes us stronger. I believe in unity, but not in forced compromises.

While we’re at it — facts cannot be “alternative;” science and climate change are real; a woman’s place is wherever she damn well pleases; gender is a construct; black lives matter; trans rights are human rights; and love is love.

I believe if we each only fight for our own concerns, as a society we will not progress nearly as far or fast as we could otherwise.

I believe that nationalism is inextricably tied up with fascism. On the other hand, we need to fight the urge to conflate nationalism and patriotism, even though someone at a podium may present both in the same breath.

Genocide is not a political position.*

I believe that empathy is both shield and sword. Both are capable of protecting. Both are just as capable of wounding.

Don’t forget: your own sword can cut you.

> Cause I know the biggest crime / Is just to throw up your hands / Say / This has nothing to do with me / I just want to live as comfortably as I can / You got to look outside your eyes / You got to think outside your brain / You got to walk outside your life / To where the neighborhood changes
> — Ani DiFranco, “Willing to Fight”

Here’s the thing:

Give more than you take. Be kind. Take care of each other.

*though people in political positions may enable or enact it.
